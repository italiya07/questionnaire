# Future Scope for the Questionnaire App

1. Expand the range of input types to include rich text editors, file upload capabilities, date pickers, and rating scales. This enhancement would allow for more diverse and detailed data collection, improving the quality and depth of survey responses.
2. Implement conditional branching and skip logic to create dynamic, adaptive questionnaires. Introduce multi-step forms with progress indicators to improve user engagement and completion rates for longer surveys.
3. Develop functionality to allow users to save their progress and return to complete the questionnaire at a later time. Implement an auto-save feature to prevent data loss due to unexpected interruptions or technical issues.
4. Connect the application to a robust backend API and database system. This integration would enable secure data storage, advanced analytics, and the potential for real-time data processing and reporting.
5. Develop a comprehensive admin panel for questionnaire management, user role assignment, and result analysis. This addition would significantly enhance the application's versatility and empower non-technical users to manage the system effectively.
6. Establish CI/CD pipelines (i.e. GitHub Actions) to automate testing and deployment processes. This implementation would streamline development workflows, ensure code quality, and facilitate rapid, reliable updates to the production environment.
7. Introduce timed mode for completing questionnaires and support one-time view only questions to enhance security and time-sensitivity of responses.
8. Animated UI element
9. Incorporate animated UI elements to improve navigation fluidity and overall user experience.
